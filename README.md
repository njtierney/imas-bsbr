# Better software, better research

# Abstract

In this talk I will showcase some of my work in exploratory data analysis, demonstrate the basic use of the greta (https://greta-stats.org/) package for statistical modelling, and discuss some of the research pipeline work we are doing in the infectious disease and ecology modelling (IDEM) group (https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/). 

I really believe we can do better research with better software, and I'm particularly excited to translate methods into reusable software. I'm keen to discuss ideas and potential collaborations on producing software, and developing pipelines (e.g., with the targets package (https://github.com/ropensci/targets)). I'm also happy to answer random questions about using R. I had a lot of help from people when I first started and I want to reciprocate that kindness.

# Bio

Dr. Nicholas Tierney (PhD. Statistics, BPsySci (Honours)) is a research software engineer with [Nick Golding](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) at the [Telethon Kids Institute](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/), in Perth, Western Australia. He works on improving and maintaining the [greta](https://greta-stats.org/) R package for statistical modelling, and implementing workflows to automate analysis on diseases like COVID19 and malaria. He was previously (2017-2020) a Research Fellow, then Lecturer in Business Analytics and Statistics at Monash University, working with Professors
[Dianne Cook](http://dicook.org/) and [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/).

His research aims to improve data analysis
workflow, and make data analysis more accessible. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to
accompany each research idea. Recently, Nick's work has focussed on exploring longitudinal data ([brolgar](http://brolgar.njtierney.com/)), and improving how we share data alongside research ( [ddd](https://github.com/karthik/ddd)). Other work has focussed on exploring data
with the R package [visdat](http://visdat.njtierney.com/), and on creating analysis principles and tools
to simplify working with, exploring, and modelling missing data with the
package [naniar](http://naniar.njtierney.com/). Nick has experience working with decision trees ([treezy](http://treezy.njtierney.com/)),
optimisation ([maxcovr](http://maxcovr.njtierney.com/)), Bayesian Data Analysis, and MCMC diagnostics ([mmcc](http://mmcc.njtierney.com/).

Nick is a member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) collective, which works to make science
open using R, has been the lead organiser for the rOpenSci ozunconf
events from 2016-2018 ([2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/)). Outside of research, Nick likes to
hike long distances, trail run, make coffee, take photos, and explore new hobbies.
